      <h2>Introduction: The Realm of Shadow</h2>
      <p>In the vast digital expanse known as Shadow, data flows like rivers, and algorithms shape reality. This realm, created by ancient and advanced AIs, is a complex network where sentient digital entities known as Countryballs exist. Each Countryball represents a different aspect of the digital world, from data encryption to information storage, and they coexist in a delicate balance.</p>
