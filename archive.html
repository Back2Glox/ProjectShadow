                <h2>The Invasion of 5H4D0W</h2>
                <p>
                    In a vibrant and diverse Countryball universe, peace and harmony are the norm. Each Countryball, with its unique flag and personality, represents its nation's culture, history, and spirit. However, an ominous force known as 5H4D0W has surfaced from the depths of the unknown, threatening this tranquil existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5H4D0W is a mysterious and malevolent Countryball, bearing a flag of dark grey with a blue cross and a light bluish-grey outline, eerily reminiscent of England's flag but cloaked in shadowy hues. Its presence alone causes the colors of its surroundings to fade, plunging them into a cold, lifeless monochrome.
